# Taste-It
Taste-It allows customers/users to view restaurant menus and order food online from restaurants that have added their menus at the [Tasty](https://menunav.herokuapp.com/) Website/App! Users who sign up may make food purchases from different restaurants at a time, while non-account users may only view restaurant menus.

3. Send their orders to corresponding restaurants
4. Enhance app responsiveness/ user experience design
5. Add user profile page
